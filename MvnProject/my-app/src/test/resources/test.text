Whenever you play the game of thrones, you either win or die. There is no middle ground.
Some war against sword and spear to win, and the others the crow and the paper to win.
Dead history is write in ink, the living sort in blood.
They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave.
Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow. Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Nightâ€™s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
The more you love, the weaker you are.
The lies we tell for love. May the gods forgive me.
Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.
Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm, or the gods, or love: illusions. Only the ladder is real; the climb is all there is.
